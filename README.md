The website developed as part of the food ordering project serves as a comprehensive outlet management system for owners. Built using **React.js**, the website offers a user-friendly interface and a range of features that facilitate efficient management of the outlet's operations.

#### Links

#### Key features 

* **Outlet Menu Management:** The website enables owners to perform CRUD operations on the menu. They can easily add, update, and delete food items, ensuring that the menu is always up to date and reflects the available options.

* **Outlet Information:** Owners can update important information about their outlet, such as contact details, address, working hours

* **Order Tracking:** The website provides a centralized platform for owners to track and manage incoming orders. Owners can view details of each order, including the items ordered, delivery preferences, and customer information.

* **Real-Time Notifications:** The website offers real-time notifications to owners, keeping them informed about new orders.

* **Analytics and Reporting:** The website includes analytics features that provide owners with valuable insights into their business. They can access data on popular menu items, sales performance, and different outlets comparison (the ones they own).

        * **Ready Orders:** This section contains orders that are marked as prepared and ready for pickup.
    * The entire order handling process works in real time with notifications being sent to the user at each stage automatically.

        * **Revenue Generated:** This lets the owner know how much revenue was generated by an outlet on a given date, month, or year.

# Setting the project locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
